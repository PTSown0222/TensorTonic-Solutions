This repository serves as a technical log of my journey implementing core Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms from the ground up

Here you'll find my solutions to various machine learning and deep learning problems from [TensorTonic](https://www.tensortonic.com/profile).

## What is TensorTonic?

TensorTonic is a platform where you can implement core algorithms of Machine Learning from scratch.

This repository contains my personal solutions to these problems, automatically synchronized from the platform.
